This is my first python project, which obtains URL or html source code file as input from the user.
It retrieves information like
1. Page Title
2. Number of occurences of words given with in paragraph tag i.e <p>
3. List of E-Mail's in that webpage in any of the following format:
   -> abc@domain.com
   -> abc@domain(dot)com
   -> abc(at)domain(dot)com
   -> Email in Ascii Format
   -> Obfuscated Email
4. List of all links from the webpage, excluding e-mails
